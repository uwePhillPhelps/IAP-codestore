# IAP CodeStore
Use (your own copy of) this template repository to store and retrieve code for <a href="https://github.com/uwePhillPhelps/IAP-2023/">Introductory Audio Programming (IAP)</a>

## How to
A simple way to proceed is to 

1. make your own github account by <a href="https://github.com/signup">signing up</a>.

1. use github to *fork* your own copy of this repository for your own github account

1. use github to *commit* your `IAP.h` and `IAP.cpp` files (in your own copy of this repository) as you create and work
   
## Benefits

Your work is then always in a convenient online location, backed up and stored safely. 😊👍

You may use standard git / github features to (for example) tag your stored files, use git branches, <a href="../../commits/master/">browse commit history</a>, and to simply search for and find your work later. 

## More information

Read more about standard git / github features on the <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/>github documentation website</a> and of course you may read step-by-step instructions as part of the <a href="https://github.com/uwePhillPhelps/IAP-2023/">Introductory Audio Programming (IAP)</a> tutorial materials.
